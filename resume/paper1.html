    <h3>Abstract:</h3>
    <p>Different types of high schools in Taiwan have the same physical education curriculum. In this cross-sectional study, we investigated the difference in the prevalence of metabolic syndrome between senior and vocational high school students. We retrospectively collected health check-up data from 81,076 first-year senior and 68,863 vocational high school students in Taipei City from 2011 to 2014, including their blood pressure, height, weight, waist circumference, fasting blood glucose, total cholesterol, triglyceride, and HDL-c levels. The prevalence of metabolic syndrome was determined using definitions from the Taiwan Pediatric Association (TPA), International Diabetes Federation (IDF), and de Ferranti et al. The prevalence of metabolic syndrome was 1.73% (senior and vocational high school students: 1.22% and 2.33%, respectively) using TPA criteria, 1.02% (0.69% and 1.40%, respectively) using IDF criteria, and 5.11% (3.92% and 6.51%, respectively) using de Ferranti et al. criteria. The most prevalent risk factors overall were increased blood pressure and central obesity. Given the significantly higher prevalence of metabolic syndrome in vocational school students regardless of the criteria, and that metabolic syndrome causes future adult health risks, the physical education curriculum and health education program in vocational schools should be strengthened to decrease the risk and prevalence of metabolic syndrome.</p>

    <h3>Methods:</h3>
    <p>In this cross-sectional study, health data of first-year high school students in Taipei from 2011-2014 were retrospectively collected. Exclusion criteria were applied, yielding 81,076 senior and 68,863 vocational students for the study. Three definitions of metabolic syndrome were applied from TPA, IDF, and de Ferranti et al. Measurements such as height, weight, and waist circumference were carried out by trained technicians. BP was measured automatically, and blood samples were analyzed in a central lab. Data stratification was done based on age and school types. For analysis, t-tests, chi-square tests, and logistic regression were used.</p>

    <h3>Results:</h3>
    <p>The research involved 149,939 high school students, of which 54.07% were regular high school students and 45.93% were vocational high school students. Vocational high school students were generally older and had different health indicators compared to regular high school students, such as BMI, blood sugar, and blood pressure. In terms of school types, most regular high school students came from public schools, while vocational high school students primarily came from private schools. Based on different diagnostic criteria, a certain proportion of high school students had risk factors for metabolic syndrome, and the risk was higher among vocational high school students. Using the de Ferranti criteria, only 55.26% of regular high school students and 49.43% of vocational high school students had no risk factors. Overall, the most common risk factors were elevated blood pressure and central obesity. Additionally, male students had a higher prevalence of metabolic syndrome under all three criteria compared to female students.</p>

    <h3>Conclusions:</h3>
    <p>The prevalence of metabolic syndrome was significantly higher in vocational students than in senior high school students. Adolescent metabolic syndrome is a high-risk factor for future cardiovascular disease. Our findings emphasize the importance of revising the physical education curriculum in high schools to reduce interschool differences in metabolic syndrome risk. Furthermore, the amount of physical education designated in the curriculum should be increased and the health education program of schools should be strengthened to decrease the risk and prevalence of metabolic syndrome and promote adolescent health.</p>
